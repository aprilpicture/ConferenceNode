MOA is the most complex adaptive optics concept proposed for the E-ELT and simulating the instrument at full scale is extremely compute-intensive.

Since collecting real-world training text images for font recognition is extremely difficult, we have to resort to synthetic training data, which unfortunately has a large domain mismatch from the real-world test examples. Besides data augmentation techniques of adding synthetic degradations, we also present a domain adaptation framework to bring the gap between synthetic training and real-world testing.

DB2 will detect both the presence of GPU cards in the server and the opportunity in queries to shift the processing of certain core operations to the GPU. The required data will be copied into the GPU memory, the operation performed and the results sent back to the P8 processor for any remaining processing. The objective is to 1) reduce the elapsed time for the operation and 2) Make more CPU available to other SQL processing and increase overall system throughput by moving intensive CPU processing tasks to GPU.","length":"15","level":"1","pdfUrl":"http:\/\/on-demand.gputechconf.com\/gtc\/2015\/presentation\/S5835-Sina-Meraji.pdf","title":"DB2 BLU w\/GPU Demo: Concurrent Execution of an Analytical Workload on a POWER8 Server with K40 GPUs","sessionTopic1":"118","sessionTopic2":"","sessionTopic3":"","sessionTopic4":"","sessionTopic5":"","type":"1","videoUrl":"http:\/\/on-demand.gputechconf.com\/gtc\/2015\/video\/S5835.html","speakerInfo":[{"name":"Sina Meraji, PhD","organization":"IBM","email":"Sinamera@ca.ibm.com","jobTitle":"Hardware Acceleration Laboratory, SWG"},{"name":"Berni Schiefer","organization":"IBM","email":"schiefer@ca.ibm.com","jobTitle":"Technical Executive, Information Management Performance and Benchmarks"}]},{"id":"S5836","lsoUID":"2207","description":"Can 3D save lives?

More massive than our Sun, yet spinning faster than a kitchen blender and sending jets of radio waves out from their magnetic poles, these exotic cosmic lighthouses are key to understanding gravity and allowing us to ask the question: was Einstein right?
